# Bluetooth Low Energy in Arduino 101

## Chapter 12: Project: Remote Control LED


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy in Arduino 101_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using Arduino 101.

This chapter teaches how to create a remotely controlled LED using the onboard LED that can be switched on and off with command from a connected Remote Control
